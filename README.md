2.5D game made with Unity. You wake up in a bank safe. Why? Good question. While you try to escape, the bankâ€™s alarm rings off. No choice, you must wipe off the waves of guards to access the next floor. Your goal? Try to reach the rooftop. Perhaps a hang gliding is waiting for you, who knows? Good luck!
